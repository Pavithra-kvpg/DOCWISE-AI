# 🩺 DOCWISE-AI
A Smart Medical History Analyzer and Doctor Recommendation System

## 🧠 Abstract
**DocWise AI** is an intelligent prototype that analyzes medical documents and recommends doctors automatically.  
Using **OCR**, **NLP**, and **AI-based Summarization**, it extracts and interprets information from reports and connects diseases to relevant specialists.

It integrates:
- **Tesseract OCR**, **PyMuPDF** – for text extraction  
- **spaCy**, **Transformers (BART/T5)** – for NLP and summarization  
- **SQLite** – for doctor data storage  
- **KivyMD** – for an interactive GUI  

DocWise AI maps **56 diseases** to **22 specializations** and holds **1,000+ doctor profiles**.

## 🩻 System Modules

### 1. PDF Report Reader
- Extracts text from reports (PDFs, scans).
- Uses **OCR** for clean text extraction.

### 2. Disease Matcher
- Detects symptoms and disease keywords using **NLP**.
- Matches them against a curated medical dataset.

### 3. Report Summarizer
- Condenses lengthy text using **Transformer-based models**.
- Keeps key medical details intact.

### 4. Suggested Action Generator
- Suggests next medical steps (tests or doctor visits).

### 5. Disease-to-Doctor Mapper
- Maps detected disease to correct specialization.

### 6. Doctor Database
- Contains verified doctor profiles with details.

### 7. Matching Engine
- Filters and ranks doctors by location and expertise.

### 8. Recommendation Engine
- Displays best matches in a clean **KivyMD interface**.
